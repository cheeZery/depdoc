DepDoc helps you document the dependencies of your project, currently supporting Composer and Node packages.

#### Usage

###### Creating and updating dependencies file

```
composer run depdoc update
```

Creates and updates a DEPENDENCIES.md file in your repository, which contains every installed Composer and Node package, its version and description, and offers you a way to document why and how you use this package.

By adding a lock emoji (ðŸ”’) after the version number, you can document that this package should not be updated.

###### Validating dependencies file

```
composer run depdoc validate
```

Validates that every installed dependency is documented in DEPENDENCIES.md. Also makes sure that no package surpasses its locked version.#
